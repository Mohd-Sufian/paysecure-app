# paysecure-app
PaySecure Application is a lightweight backend service built using Java and Spring Boot to simulate a payment-status API.
The application is containerized with Docker and deployed on Amazon EKS using Kubernetes manifests, demonstrating real-world DevOps, cloud-native, and container orchestration practices.

This repository focuses on the application, containerization, and Kubernetes deployment layer, while infrastructure provisioning is managed separately using Terraform.
